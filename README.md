This project is a real-time chat application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and Socket.IO for real-time bi-directional communication. The application allows users to register, log in, and chat with other users in real-time. Messages are stored in MongoDB for persistence, and new messages are pushed instantly using WebSockets.
